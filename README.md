# Real-time AI Intrusion Detection System

A sophisticated real-time intrusion detection system with visual attack simulation and AI-powered threat analysis. This project provides an interactive web dashboard for monitoring and responding to cyber threats.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Attack Detection**: Monitor and detect suspicious login attempts and potential intrusions
- **Visual Attack Simulation**: Matrix-style animation and world map visualization of attack patterns
- **Interactive Response System**: Manual and automatic IP blocking capabilities
- **Attack Pattern Analysis**: AI-powered pattern recognition for different types of attacks
- **Live Statistics**: Real-time monitoring of attack counts, blocked IPs, and active threats
- **Geographic Visualization**: World map display showing attack origins and paths
- **Packet Visualization**: Real-time visualization of network packets during attacks

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python with Flask web framework
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- **Security**: IP-based intrusion detection and blocking
- **Visualization**: Custom CSS animations and interactive map
- **Data Storage**: File-based logging system

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   Python 3.x
   Flask
   ```

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository (✅ Already completed)
   git clone https://github.com/Ramcharan0600/AI-Intrusion-Detection.git

   # Navigate to the project directory (Next step ➡️)
   cd real_ids_app

   # Create a Python virtual environment (Optional but recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/Mac:
   # source venv/bin/activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Running the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## 💻 Usage

1. **Monitor Attacks**
   - View real-time statistics on the dashboard
   - Monitor active threats and attack patterns
   - Track blocked IPs and total attack attempts

2. **Simulate Attacks**
   - Use the "Generate New Attack" button to simulate realistic attack scenarios
   - Watch the visual representation of attacks on the world map
   - Observe matrix-style animations and packet visualization

3. **Respond to Threats**
   - Manually block suspicious IPs
   - View and manage blocked IP addresses
   - Clear all blocks when needed

## 🔒 Security Features

- IP-based threat detection
- Automated blocking of suspicious activity
- Manual override capabilities
- Real-time alert system
- Attack pattern recognition
- Geographic origin tracking

## 🎯 Attack Patterns

The system recognizes various attack patterns including:
- Brute Force Attacks
- Dictionary Attacks
- Targeted Attacks

Each pattern has unique characteristics and visual representations in the dashboard.

## 📊 Visualization Components

1. **World Map**
   - Shows attack origin and destination
   - Animated attack paths with moving dots
   - Real-time path visualization

2. **Matrix Animation**
   - Dynamic code-like display
   - Real-time updates during attacks

3. **Packet Visualization**
   - Animated network packet simulation
   - Visual representation of attack intensity
